This is my [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon) configuration.

I swapped my `caps lock` key with `ctrl` using OS X keyboard preferences, then used [Seil](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en) to remap the `caps lock` key (which is now `ctrl` physical key) to `F19` (a key that doesn't exist on my keyboard but has a `keycode`)then used [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/index.html.en) to transform `F19` into `ctrl`+`alt`+`cmd`+`shift` pressed together.

So these are the kyebinding list:
