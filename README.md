This is my [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon) configuration.

I swapped my `caps lock` key with `ctrl` using OS X keyboard preferences, then used [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) to make `caps lock` (which is the `ctrl` physical key) key to `F19` (a key that doesn't exist on my keyboard but has a `keycode`) then through hammerspoon I make a modal key that acts like a `hyper` key.
